-- Correct the comments related to whether changing the map will affect 
the internally stored map of RangeBasedTunnelLocalization. I was first 
using point cloud but later switched to octree. Thus everytime the map 
changes, octree has to be regenerated. Also remove the internal map since 
it is no longer used. Also add warnings saying that set_map might cause significant slow-downs.

-- Carry the estimation inside the callback functions instead of the main loop.

-- Since I am using only octree, update set_map functions to set_octree. This will assume that
the user pre-constructs the tree. This was possible multiple octree generations are going to
be prevented.

-- Project the tracked point onto the map with projected optical flow vector.
-- Project the image to assign colors to the point cloud map for visualization

-- In odometry visualization, plot the camera and laser using the calibration params.
Use triangle list to visualize area spanned by the optical flow vector, back-projections and
robot center.

-- Incorporate the image masking into tracker and extractor
